Property Manager (Jason) is outstanding along with his team. Currently, live in a courtyard facing unit and you can hear the water from the fountain (so peaceful). Previously lived in a two-bedroom loft and the layout was amazing. Will upgrade to a larger unit like the loft by the end of the year.  Love how well the parking deck is locked down. Couldn't say enough about this community. I have also heard there are some really cool upgrades coming to this property within the next year which I am excited to see!",Donald Del Nero,5

1/21/2021,JTA044976,1900917,MAA Mount Vernon,google,MAA,"Wonderful community; excellence maintenance people.  HORRIFYING management.  We have had nothing but trouble with them.  They messed up our on line monthly lease payment (btw, the ONLY option) and would not reimburse us a nominal $150.00 fee after several conversations, email, paper trails.  There have been many occasions that the trash compactor is out of order; it piles up and is a health hazard.  There is always an excuse for why things don't function properly.  There is a car that has been parked here in the same spot since we have lived here for 1.5 years and they refuse to have it towed.  The turnover in the office underscores how powerless the lease agents are in satisfying the renters.  Do yourselves a favor and don't lease from this company.

 we have had the exterminator in our apartment for new fewer than six times (once weekly).  He is not able to eradicate the ants.  I asked for a refund on the pest control fee and was denied.  In addition, the 3rd party maintenance people (landscaping, remodeling) don't wear masks.  When I was out walking today, not ONE person had a mask on.  Ridiculous.

Pest control scheduled again.  Still no willingness on management's part to adjust the nominal fees for something they cannot resolve.

Received a ""community update"" touting how well they are addressing a persistent trash problem.  The maintenance staff is fantastic but the management if HORRIBLE.  We wish we never moved here.  The office staff is powerless and incapable of responding to the residents' needs.  NOT worth the price!",Lori Fineman,2

But i gotta say.. ive had quite a few issues considering I’ve only lived here for 3 months. My bedroom gets so cold and my roommates gets so hot so it’s hard to find a neutral temperature where we’re both comfy. Our light switches in the bedroom don’t work. That’s really annoying. We have to pull the string on the fan. We’ve had some plumbing problems. Also the complex neglected to tell us that we’re right next to a train that runs about 18 hours a day and is super loud. I’ve grown used to it but it’s annoying we weren’t warned. The trash is always always backed up and the gate has been broken half the time I’ve lived here when part of what I’m paying for is a gated community. There is little grass, and not a single fenced in area for my dog. That’s been a huge draw back. There are so many areas they could make into a dog park and havent. Lastly maintenance takes forever and when they do come they come early and BANG on the door for about five minutes before coming in. I don’t think I’ll renew because of MAA, but i do love the apartment itself.",Lindsey Marcus,3

1/21/2021,JTA001543,1901157,Colonial Grand at Lakewood Ranch,apartmentratings,MAA,"The community is aesthetically pleasing , pool and gym are small for a community of this size ,however the quality of workmanship inside of the units is poor. I was not shown the unit I moved into and when that day came the carpets were filthy with a nasty oder, I wanted to turn around and run. My move was delayed as I had to wait for new carpet to be installed . I was promised early morning they didn't arrive until 2pm didn't wear masks and now my son and I are not well and headed to get COVID tests. I had to rush my son out of the apartment when they started cutting I couldn't believe it as I told them to give me a minute to get him out to send him off to grandma until this drama was over. The manager even noted that the unit should never have been on the market in that state. It was indeed disgraceful ! I was not offered a discount for my inconvenience. Additionally the offer of $100 back upon application process was promised to be added to my statement as a credit, that didn't happen. The maintenance jobs are done with not much effort and incomplete with no confirmation of when they will be. The workmen don't wear protective footwear which is not to my liking and rather unsanitary. That should be mandatory! There are hundreds of dogs on this property and needless to say not everyone follows the rules so yes that's another issue. I have been charged by two big dogs in one week of living here, not acceptable. Had I known I would be facing the park where the kids scream at the top of their lungs I would not have moved in here. I loved children I have two of my own, but between that the dogs barking and the loud music that seems to be a pattern it's just not what I thought it would be at all. The garbage area is disgusting !!! I just pray things get better. I hope I can find some peace and try to enjoy being here . I will do my best to have an open mind if I could only hear myself think!!! The walls are paper thin. The windows are not up to hurricane standards so your electric bill will be high . Oh might I add that upon move in the hot water was not working and the plumbing was terrible . It was fixed fast but I had to go to the office only to be reprimanded that all maintenance reports are to be submitted on the portal . Seriously? It was day one and I was supposed to know that in the midst of all the crazy? Really all I wanted was a damn shower !!! I am so done because I know good and well if I were of a different origin my apartment would have been in tip top shape period!!! Now I understand why the agent steered me in the wrong direction the first time and I arrived at an occupied unit , then when I got back to the office she told me oh don't worry it's exactly like the model I showed you . Now I know why she didn't want me to see this place . Not even a new carpet can remove the stench of a dog. My son has asthma he had to sleep at my mothers house during all if this. Additionally!!! The cable ports on the walls were defective it took a week to get it taken care of,yet I was charged the full amount so I hope whom ever reads this understand I expect a prorated bill for services NOT rendered in a timely fashion. YES adjustments need to be made in kind and thanks in advance for your understanding and full cooperation. I have a long list of maintenance issues that I will place on the portal . I am honestly mortified I should have done my due diligence. The icing on the the cake is I found mice dropping in my bathroom yesterday and I bleached it down twice since occupying the unit . I have a bit if OCD so I know they were not there the night before as I had just installed a new shower curtain . I can't i just can't !!!!! Pist is a mild understatement. The neighborhood is nice the people who live here are friendly for the most part and the maintenance crew are very nice people , I think they may need more help which is why jobs get delayed or perhaps their work isn't overseen accordingly until a complaint comes in. The manager was very cooperative and understanding when she found out about the state of affairs. On a side note I requested a copy of my lease from the agent and she seemed as though I was asking for her first born . Yes it's in the portal but for my records I wanted a hard copy and I didn't think it was too much ask . She was as sweet as pie initially very empathetic then things turned and it became more condescending. Seriously trying to tell me oh that one spot in the rug can be cleaned the rest is fine I didn't es t to argue because my money is green just like everyone else's . The nerve !!! I couldn't be in the unit 10 minutes without needing Benadryl. Imagine my poor son he would have had to be nebulized. If I had it my way I'd get the he'll out if here immediately!!!!

I am so grateful for Ashley, George, and Thomas they truly make this a wonderful place to live. It's so quite and peaceful it truly does feel like home.

They send out an email at least once a week about them breaking in and till this day, there's still no security! You'd think for the price you pay they would have 24/7 security but they don't. They're very demanding when it comes to their money but when it comes to you needing maintenance or anything. Nope. They take forever. And apparently now you can't even have stuff in YOUR patio that isn't patio furniture cause you'll get a fine. What's that about? Like I said. I hate this place. Can't wait to move out.",Nelly H.,1

Previous reviews mention issues with bugs but when I saw a few in my 1st floor apartment I contacted maintenance and they had someone spray the place the next morning and no sightings since! Biggest issue is trash: only one dumpster for all the buildings and a compactor they want you to use but don't tell you about or give you directions to, but they charge you almost $10/mo for.

Only real issue was my building had a roach problem. We are pretty clean and was a pretty systematic problem we have not had to deal with at other apartment complexes. Though we would request roach ""treatment"" and they would come within a day or two, the pest control person would literally be in and out of the apartment less than 5 minutes.

Needless to say, I absolutely love it here! The staff couldn't be nicer. I mostly interact with Michelle in the leasing office and she is always so nice and pleasant to work with. She has a great memory and is on top of her game any time I speak with her. If I ever reach out to any of the staff members with questions or concerns, I never feel like a burden and they are always happy to help me. They are also always quick to respond if there is ever an issue and quality customer service is something that I don't take lightly.

The complex itself is a little older versus some of the others in the area but the upkeep on it doesn't show it. The units aren't rundown and don't look old or grungy at all. It's also in a great and safe location with close access to nice grocery stores, shopping centers, and restaurants as well as close access to the highways I-4 and the 417.

Like any housing addition there are mixed ideologies and requests are extremely mixed and yet she continues each day with a positive attitude. MAA has multiple complexes through the Dallas Ft. Worth area and will allow residents to transfer leases etc. within those complexes if units become available. I have recently renewed my original lease because I know as problems arise I will get a fair shake and at least be dealt with on an equitable basis. Our maintenance team has improved 200% and responds to any emergency quickly. We are close to hospitals, fire-paramedics, police, and the community is gated.

The only thing to be aware of is, spectrum internet and cable are included in the rent, so if you don't want cable or internet with Spectrum..to bad, you'll be paying for it anyway.

The apartments are somewhat dated with the carpet and color of the walls, but overall are still in good shape and have ample space and look nice enough. The bathroom can leave much to be desired with size, but also the sinks are rather small and the fan always turns on when using the lights. There is a nice pool and decent gym considering the size of the building. Parking can be problematic at night, but not a major issue usually. Depending on your location within the complex the recycling, gym, pool, and other amenities may be a short walk away.

1/18/2021,JTA040979,1896052,Colonial Village at South Tryon,google,MAA,"My wife and I are thankful for MAA South Tryon (previously Colonial Village at South Tryon), we have lived here for almost a year now. A series of unfortunate events led us to struggling to find somewhere to live upon my retirement from the military, moving here from Missouri for my wife's work. Admittedly, this wasn't where we desired to live but, we didn't have much of a choice and they were the only ones willing to work with us. However, it has been a much better experience than we had anticipated. Minus a few minor issues, our apartment was well prepared though, I believe it was because the previous tenants did not care for it well and it needed quite a bit of work. At any rate, it was very clean and smelled fresh upon arrival. I believe the Management and Maintenance personnel are doing their best to make this a respectable apartment community. They have been very accommodating to our questions and concerns and have done a great job fulfilling all maintenance requests. Tenants have gotten slightly better at putting their trash in the new, fully functioning dumpster but, they still do not know how to pick up their pet feces. Our neighbor directly across from us is wonderful and our 1st floor neighbor directly below us is great as well. The location is quite convenient to many things in and around Charlotte and I-77 and I-485 are literally right next to us. South Carolina, Carowinds and the Charlotte Airport are only minutes away. The management cannot control the neighborhood and area around us and that's where most of our reservations are. We don't feel completely safe and comfortable here, not because of the apartment complex itself but, because of the surrounding area. Overall we are happy and thankful to be here and are likely to remain here for some time.",Thomas Hastings,5

1/18/2021,JTA000221,1896943,Hunters Ridge At Deerwood,apartmentratings,MAA,It has been absolutely great. I think the price is about 150 dollars to much but I love the apartment. The age of the apartments and the quality of hardware in the apartments in my opinion doesn't really justify the price and I personally think that the cost of renting at apartments as of today including this one is way to high. It puts a damper on economic growth and the prices should either come down or be forced to come down to the desire for greed over taking the idea of simply providing a service.,Verified Resident,4

MAAC corp. is certainly is doing well on The stock-exchange. Please help these hard workers, James Ivan, Jason and Sean in the maintenance dept, by hiring more reliable workers to assist them. Also, Re-filling landscape bushes and ground coverage needs attention!! Most renters are from the midwest of our country and they are HUGE cigarette smokers. The cigarette butts are all over the grounds, rarely do we get to see the beautiful green grass. In the midwest , there are blankets of snow on the ground 8 months of the year so their habit is to ""flick"" the butts !! Our natural environment is trash/liter free because all Floridians know this important rule of NO LITTERING ever! There are no native Floridians in the MAAC offices in this area so the grounds look alittle shabby. We have sunshine 24/7 in beautiful Florida!

We didn't realize we were that loud. We soon found out walls are thin because nearly every day we hear our upstairs neighbor walking from room to room. Sometimes the walking is so loud it sounds like stomping. It even rattles the mirror on our wall and the glass cups in our cabinets. We just never filed a complaint because we assumed that you cannot change the way someone walks. We know next time to get a top floor apartment. Also when we have guests, we realized that you cannot open the garage from your phone for them to drive up to the visitor parking. The phone only controls the outside door that leads to the hallways. We had to come down from our apartment to open the garage for our visitors. If there were a call box located by the garage door, that would be awesome ! Other than that, we really love Market Station and plan on renewing our lease ! Everyone is actually really friendly and maintenance have been on time and very polite during our visits.

1/18/2021,JTA004504,1897026,Woodhollow,apartmentratings,MAA,When we moved into this apartment community we were very excited and liked the overall look of the place. It's in a nice area close to shopping and schools. After living here almost a year we can say that is nice on the surface but there is a lot of issues. We constantly have marijuana smell coming through bathroom exhaust vents and through the doors and sliding glass doors. The AC systems are very very old and not energy efficient so electric bills are high during summer. The water bills are shared among all tenants in the same building. The carpets were not deep cleaned before we moved in and we vacuumed up bags full of dog hair. We have to constantly use odor eliminating powder on the carpets because they smell like wet dog all the time. The floors are very thin so if you live on a second floor and have kids your neighbors downstairs will constantly complain from your kids running down a hall or if you don't don't creep around the apartment like a ninja. They are old apartments that have been dolled up to look newer and you can tell when you see all the patches in the walls and paint over mold in the bathrooms. When we moved in we smelled fresh paint and now we can see why because the paint is peeling off of the walls where they didn't clean off mold and dirt they tried to paint over. For the cost of $1100 a month there were better options in other places for the same price or slightly more. I would not recommend this place unless you are on limited time and need a place fast but I would stay longer then 1 year lease before finding a house or better apartment complex that's safer and in better condition.,Verified Resident,2

Holes that were in the wall are poorly patched and painted over. There are no lights in the living room so you'll need to bring your own lights. Maintenance may fix your issue on the first visit more than likely they won't and you'll have to call again. There are potholes in the parking lot that don't get fixed. And if your neighbor leaves food and garbage outside to rot they won't clean it up. So the outside of your apartment will smell like rotting food until it completely decomposes.,Verified Resident,2

The dog waste stations have been very helpful to clean up dog waste (even though some people will let their animals go right in front of them and not clean it up) and is a nice amenity so that I do not need to order my own bags. Two downsides are the ever increasing rent and the forced cable package we have to pay $90 each month for even if we are not using it. This should be optional especially for folks like myself who only use the internet.,Verified Resident,4

Staff doesn't seem to care about anything other than there own convince. I reached out staff about mold. Nothing was done. Maintenance left vent unscrewed. Mentioned it several times. Still nothing happened- then after filling a complaint one of the staffing lady's took it upon herself to come inside without permission to & I wasn't home and I wasn't notified until after she came inside. Which would of been fine if they furthermore took steps to get rid of the mold. They haven't mentioned anything to me about it since and it's been almost a week. The lady who ""inspected"" isn't HVAC or certified if that kind of thing. I have all over my work orders to not enter without permission. I wasn't home when she came and left.

When they show you an apartment they mention that it is NEW CARPET. That's the scam, it is always new carpet. When you move out, no matter what condition the carpet is in they will charge you $750+ for them to put in a new one. If you can bite that bullet, then maybe consider this place.

I am talking about barking all day and night. HORRIBLE!! The front gates which admit tenants with a card and visitors by telephone were only operable half the time. When we signed our lease, they told us that the complex was very secure but it the gates were broken, they were wide open for weeks at a time.

I moved across country which is no small endeavor but Hayli made it beyond manageable and even more important, made it a pleasant and great transition.

She took the time to go above and beyond to show me different options of living spaces/layouts, toured me around the facility in great detail, returned countless emails I had full of questions, and to this day (living in my new apt), she continues to make sure my needs, as a resident of Post Lake, are always promptly addressed and taken care of.

I have had a lot of experience with fair to great customer service over the years, and I recognize excellent customer service when I experience it. Hayli’s diligent and pleasant approach to every situation has been outstandingly consistent and has certainly not gone unnoticed by me or my family.

Any move/change of residency is a tedious process, but moving across country requires even more attention to detail and efficiency to make that transition work smoothly. Hayli worked with me every step of the way to make it a seamlessly smooth transition and one I am beyond pleased with. I love my new home, the community that surrounds me, and sincerely appreciate knowing I have hard working individuals, like Hayli, who make living here such an enjoyable experience.

It should also be said that all the amazing staff at Post Lake, whether on the grounds, maintenance, and/or in the leasing office, have been nothing short of professional and courteous to all my needs as their resident. I am grateful to you all. My hat tips extra big to you Hayli! You have been outstanding to me, every step of they way. Thank you!

I work all day, every day, and still have to pay the consequences for the pandemic. There's always more money to be paid each month and it's starting to not be worth it. On top of the fees, the front staff is FAKE (with the exception to one person who I don't remember her name). They pretend to care about your questions or concerns. I've called to ask about increasing fees and they always say someone will call me back but no one ever does. Lenard once told me that the sewage fee was based on my BUILDING'S use, not just my apartment. When I asked for clarification he hung up on me. I know from a friend that moving out is a nightmare.

I would never in my life recommend this property to ANYONE. The staff is wonderful, the maintenance guys are nice, but it's having to deal with the property manager that makes living here such a nightmare. Your water will be shut off constantly. In our 2+ years living here our water was shut off atleast once every 3 months because of ""leaks"". When we first moved in we went 24 hrs with no water, and no notice that we would be without water for that long. People do not pick up after their pets. People walk their dogs off leashes (and no management doesn't do anything about it even when you give the pets info. But I promise you if an accident ever happens that isn't your fault, you will 100% reap the consequences of it.) If you plan to move in with pets be prepared for a heft deposit fee that you will NOT see when you move out because they will rip your carpet up (no matter how clean and taken care of it is) and find stains underneath the carpet and charge you for brand new carpet! Stains are NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR under the state laws of Arizona so legally they should not be charging for this as long as it is not significantly stained to the visible eye or damaged. So stains underneath do not consent to replacing of carpet. If you need a place to live because your dog falls under breed restrictions I highly recommend RentProgress! For the price of these apartments you will get a house instead for your fur baby! Also, you will struggle to find parking in this complex constantly. One assigned parking spot for more than 1 person in an apartment is a nightmare. If you do decide to live here, or perhaps already do, please be aware that you are entitled to a FREE carpet cleaning once a year every year you rent !! We found this out 3 weeks before move out!

My neighbors like to have a lot of people over and fight often. I've submitted several complaints and have been told something would be done. It hasn't. Second, the staff can be extremely pompous and off-putting. There was an issue where, I guess, residents were bringing glass and staying after-hours at the pool. The entire community received a strongly-worded, unprofessional email from the Leasing Manager about how they will not tolerate ""blatant refusal"" to follow guidelines. It made me very uncomfortable. Thankfully, I haven't had any major cosmetic or damage issues in this apartment, otherwise this review might be more angry.

My boyfriend and I drove from Colorado to our new apartment on the 31st of December and we arrived on January, 01, 2021. It could not have been a better way to start our year right?! Well, thats what we thought but we were very desapointed and upset. The apartment was so gross!  We could see the dirty everywhere, we felt uncomfortable and betrayed since they told us it was cleaned but they did not checked it. Nobody wants to drive for hours to a new state and have to clean every walls, doors, windows, curtains, sinks, fridge.... everything and everywhere! I had to send pictures and wait until they felt ""obligated"" to send people to clean the place like I was being a ""crazy
I am not! And neither is my neighbor that shared she went through the same situation when she moved. We wanted to arrive to a cleaned place at least(there was other issues like really old, moldy stuff in the house that could had been replaced before us asked but they do not care! (Only if you speak up for yourself until you get the job done). First, because they have to provide us a cleaned place so we don't live in anybody's else dirty (like nobody else would like neither themselves) and then we decide that we love it and we want to stay! and COVID-19!!! Do I really have to ask to be cleaned?!Neither do you so make sure before you move in that the apartment is cleaned! No need for extra stress that should not even be your problem, but theirs! The community is really cute and cleaned besides all this issues.
Here are some pictures. After 3 days calling them every day/ going to the office, they sent 2 nice ladies to clean but most of it I cleaned before because I could not live like that. I spent a lot of my time, energy and money on something that was not my problem, we were supposed to be worried about our personal lives, job, getting to know this beautiful state

I lived here for 7 months.

First, the good: We loved the carriage house, the high ceilings, floorplan, walk-in closets, and higher end finishes. Honestly, despite being notorious for high rent, we got a pretty good deal all things considered. Our move in process was easy and the staff was (usually) pretty accessible to anything we needed.

when we moved out, we agreed to pay an additional $200 for a cleaning fee. We offered to pay then, but said it would be due after inspection and move out. We left our numbers, new address and they said they would call when it was due. That never happened, instead, they sent us straight to collections, without calling once, or making contact. Now three YEARS later, the collection agency is harassing my wife and I and asking for far more saying that there was interest charged in the meantime.

I needed my car and the tow company would not hear me out or let me leave without paying. The tow company didn’t care that they were wrong. Nothing I said mattered to them, so I paid figuring that post southend would be able to do something about this since the towing company that they authorize to tow on their property wrongfully towed my car. When I reached out to the leasing office I spoke to Jennifer. She was not willing to help at all. I was told that I need to reach out to the towing company because post southend doesn’t get compensated for the towing. In other words, they didn’t care at all that my car got towed incorrectly because they don’t get paid for it. She took the easiest way out and blamed the towing company. Post should stand behind the company’s that they do business with, and at the very least look out for their residents when they’ve been wronged on their property by a company that they authorize to tow here. Post does not care about their residents unless they’re somehow compensated for it. Im very disappointed with how poorly Jennifer and post handled this situation. I was wronged out of $250 and post southend could not have cared less. They made no effort to work towards a solution and passed all the blame to the towing company.

You expect this type of customer service from a towing company, but you’d expect better from the place that you reside. They’re are a lot of good options in southend. Save yourself some stress and live somewhere that cares about their residents.",Brandon Beatty,1

Also, some balconies don't look safe to walk out on and should've been repaired months ago, but no one is doing so. Not to mention the washer and dryers that have been out of service since I moved in and are not getting fixed, I gave up going there.

1/11/2021,JTA046562,1887510,Post Barton Creek,google,MAA,"Review after 2.5 years here.
A little tip to begin: The prices are changing depending on the time of the year, so if you sign at the “low prices” season, be ready to be surprised by double digits % increase in case you have to renew the lease at a time the demand is up.

Location. Location is amazing - you’re close to downtown, you can run to Zilker park. Trader Joe’s, Costco, Whole Foods.. are within 7 min drive.

Outside feel. This is a nice, well-groomed community with beautiful views of the blooming trees and multiple units overlooking the greenbelt. The swimming pool provides a nice escape from the heat during summer time and is mostly well maintained.

Inside apartment feel. The first impression is decent. Luxurious is the last thing that comes to mind. The longer you live here the more you understand that the management uses the cheapest finishes possible to renew and repair. The kitchen granite countertops are the most quality item in the apartments, and it is my suspicion that it stayed there from the previous management. All other finishes are very (I mean very) low quality.
The scariest part is the foundation issues that are not being addressed and get worse. We lived in two apartments and growing cracks between the walls, constantly fracturing floor tile in the kitchen, and sheetrock screws sticking more and more out of the walls were evident in both of them. The appliances are old. We had animals living between the bedroom walls and making really bad noise mostly at night. It took a very long time for the team to solve this issue. Scorpions are very abundant! I would spray them and collect at first, but then just started throwing them back into the wilderness. The office will offer comprehensive extermination treatment, and our friends did it, but it solves this issue only temporarily. But you have to move all of your furniture, so we opted out. Having small kids, it makes it a nightmare. On the picture you see only about 5% of all I’ve caught. Two car garages is a huge benefit though.

Office. Everyone at the office is always Nice and responsive,  but don’t expect honesty. Pretty hight turnover. In two years we’ve been through 4 managers. We had to move into a new unit that I know, from someone who lived there before us, had a huge leak and significant water damage. When I asked the office staff member about it, they denied any water leak… Another annoying issue is that some tenants get preferential financial concessions. We were always nice and rarely complained about anything, so the management showed zero flexibility when we needed it, while I know our friends had a different treatment. That’s how this business is run, so just beware.

Maintenance. Maintenance team is mostly pretty awesome in their response times and willingness to go above and beyond to resolve your issue. There has been a high turnover as well.

Dogs. It’s a dogs paradise! There is a special park for them. Most owners are diligent about picking the poop and using the leash. There are some though that have no concept of cleaning after their dogs, so the poop is abundant around the property. The office sends emails to address the issue, but really nothing is done. Same with the leash. We had an experience when a “friendly” dog wandered into our garage, when our 3 yo was playing there, and started barking. My kid who loved dogs, is afraid to approach one after that incident.

Kids. If you have a choice, get a dog, not a kid before moving here. There are zero accommodations made for kids in this community. Taking a walk turns into anxiety producing constant watching out for passing cars, as there are no sidewalks. Any remotely “kid-friendly” landscape area will have a dog poop sitting in it. Eanes school district is great. This community is not.

Parking. Everyone has a two car garage, which some decide to use as a storage unit. There are 25 extra parking spots around the community plus you can park on the streets 3 min walk from the gates. Your car will be towed away if you park illegally. Park in your garage and you’ll be fine.",Yaron Sh,1

1/11/2021,JTA034247,1883526,Post Uptown Village,google,MAA,"This apartment has a great location! I LOVE being able to walk to so many of my favorite restaurants and bars! It's also so easy to hop on 75. The reason it didn't get full 5 stars is because it does have its faults.

The fire places and fountains don't work in the courtyard, which is a bummer because I'd like to spend time out there with a fire.
A couple of the keys to the door code entry pad for guests to use do not work, so I have to leave to come open the door for them every time.

There were reviews on here talking about homeless people wandering, and noise complaints. First of all, we're next to downtown Dallas. The apartment does not ""attract"" homeless people, you're going to see homeless people in the downtown area regardless of what apartment it is.
Secondly, uptown is known to have an active night life, and especially being so close to bars and restaurants, you'll hear the occasional drunk person or loud car driving by. (I'm on the first floor facing the street, and occasionally hear it, but it's not constant).

It is an older building, some of the units have been renovated, and some still have the older fixtures. Which I was fine with, I prefer a great location, but to each their own.
The office has always been fast with responding, which is so appreciative. I've had only one maintenance request and it was addressed within 24 hours.
I'm also always able to find parking in the garage! (which has been an issue at other places I've lived in the past).

If you're looking for ""new everything"" this probably isn't the place for you. But if you're okay with an older building, you really can't beat the location and price!",Kendall Shepherd,4
1/11/2021,JTA012156,1883522,MAA Buckhead,google,MAA,"Simply put, won't recommend this place to anyone, let alone friends. If you decide to lease, be ready to surprises, not the good ones.

A new manager took over and tried to be nice while new, but things started heading the other direction soo after. I regret complementing her for changing some things some months back.

For one, one day someone just smashed eggs on my door. When I told the manager about it, all she said was 'OH OK, WELL LET ME KNOW IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN."". I asked if she can send someone to clean, she said she would. No one ever showed up!

The past property manager had promised me complementary carpet cleaning. When I brought it to the new manager's attention, she made me feel like I was referring to something from the last century!

I returned the place much cleaner than what I had received. Still, just to make sure that they don't have to write me a check to refund my deposit, they brought up issue with carpet in one of the rooms. THe carpet was just how I had got it. I explained, but they didn't listen.

While moving out, they made me wait 2 hours, when all I had to do was return my keys! They also charged me a move-out fee, when nothing as such was mentioned in my lease.

Due to COVID, I requested my property manager to let me be on month-to-month for sometime. She agreed, in email. But, in the background, chose to have a lease of one quarter, about which she never told me, until I brought up the topic myself, the email which I had written just to make sure everything was okay.

Having guests over is difficult as parking is a problem. Fire alarm goes off so often and that too as early as 3 am!! Happens so much that people don't even care now. Only God save them if some real mishap happens, coz no one would believe that it's real this time!

You might be impressed by the new fancy office, but don't fall for it. The community right next to this one and in front of this one are amazing. I gave 2 stars instead of one, just because the maintenance staff is very nice, which is surprising, because the management is awful.",Kshitij Pandya,2

1/9/2021,JTA055867,1882479,Charlotte at Midtown,google,MAA,"I lived here for two years and my experience in the beginning was really great, however quality of life here has really decreased. I have several issues with the management team the first one being the Covid-19 super spreader party that was allowed to be hosted at the building over the summer. To make matters even worse their response was an email that basically said, ""We were informed about the party after the fact and oops our bad,"" which felt like a direct slap in the face to those of us who actually take the *global pandemic* seriously. To be frank thats how most of their emails sound about very real complaints the residents have, just empty apologies and no real change. Of course I do not expect landlords to care about their residents but if you're going to over charge for amenities we can't even use at least feign like you do.

Also I had Renter's Insurance the entire time staying there, yet was charged a fee for not having it for the second half of my stay because of their clerical errors. In addition when I asked to be present at my walk through their supervisor told me I was welcomed to come on Monday morning, I emailed Chelsea to see what exact time I could come and was ignored. Then I received a bill for after the walk through afterwards, which was extremely shady.

Like others stated there is an extremely loud train that rounds right behind the building, if I am being honest it did not bother me much. However its something to consider if you're a light sleeper. There is a dog park attached to back of building 2402 and if you enjoy the smell of dog poop and the sounds of dog fights early in the morning it'll be the perfect place for you. Theres a dumpster right outside the back of the building and if you enjoy dumpster diving its prime real estate as most people dump their old furniture out there and block the back entrance. There use to be an abandoned building in the rear of the building and you could sometimes see people do drugs back there. So if you live alone just be watchful of that. Also the ground level hallway of the 2402 building just straight up smells like dog pee sometimes. My neighbors would often throw loud parties spill alcohol in the hallways and it would not get cleaned until Monday.

All in all there are dozens, if not hundreds of over priced ""luxury"" apartments in Nashville to lease from, this one is nothing special. The ""features"" and ""updates"" they have are basic at best, even Clarksville apartments have them now. The only thing you really pay for is the location and even then there are better apartments closer downtown that are similarly priced. I think it goes without saying If I could leave zero stars, I would.

However I would like to dedicate my one star to the custodians they contract out to a different company they are the sweetest and kindest people in the building. They absolute were the greatest and watched out for me as I lived alone. Shout out to them for making the experience worth it!!! <3",Kayla Daise,1

The staff is warm and friendly, and the manager Mary Beth is one of the kindest, most down to earth people I've met.  They made us feel welcome, and we loved the apartments they showed us - so much so, that my husband and I both immediately knew it was our favorite out of all the tons of apartments we'd viewed in the previous weeks.

I love dogs so I was very happy that dogs of all breeds and sizes are welcome at this complex! That was a big plus for me.

We lived here for over a year now, and we have had a great experience. The maintenance staff and management here truly care about their residents and want them to feel at home. These apartments are super clean and everything works well. We have not seen ONE bug inside our apartment... there is no pest issue whatsoever, which is always my number one concern with apartments.

Due to some personal problem I encountered in 2015, I was forced to go and look for an apartment to live. God being so good and faithful brought me to Colonial Grand at Berkeley Lake now known as MAA Berkeley Lake. I suddenly got a phone call from Emily, the assistant property manager asking if I was still look for an apartment. I responded yes, I am. Sure enough I went after work. I was very happy with their set up.

I could attest to the fact that Emily is really very understanding and extremely very helpful. She's is so very nice that even before I was eventually signed up for the lease, I felt so very much at home despite the pain I was going through at that moment in 2015.

To talk about the property manager, Gigi Suggs, she's so very very understanding and caring. If you have any problem, she takes time to listen to you and does everything in her power to ensure you're properly taken care of. The technicians are so friendly and knowledgeable.  They are on point and fast when it comes to taking care of anything that needs to be taken care of in your apartment if you request for it.

About the apartment itself, for me, though it is an apartment, it feels more or less like an home to me. Why? Because it's big, clean, quiet, has basic amenities needed, and they usually have people take care of whatsoever needs to be taken care of most of the time. People are extremely friendly and it's very secured.

Personally, I could recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a very good apartment to live in. Like I wrote at the very top, I have been here since 2015 and I truly cannot say I have any major complaints against anyone or anything. That shows how good the management takes good care of the people and the apartment itself. Thank you.",Adejoy Ojuriayo Onikute,5

Whenever MAA purchased Post Properties is when the nightmare began. Tenant screening simply became if you had a pulse, you were in. This place felt like a bad club or a drug trafficking street corner. I saw ATF, and DEA in an elevator with bulletproof vests on once, and I saw APD about 4-5 times a week there. Constant weed smoke no matter where you were. NEVER any visitor parking available, pool being closed a good number of weekends to do this massive parties and glass being broken out there.
I am in real estate, I searched heavily at many different apartments complexes after deciding to leave here. There are much better/nice/safer apartment complexes in Atlanta. You couldn't pay me $3,000/month to stay here.
The elevators are very similar to Atlanta rush hour traffic. Never plan on running down to your Uber on a Friday night when it arrives, go ahead and give yourself at least 15/20 minutes to get down one of the remaining working elevators. The elevators were terrible, dog pee and feces often inside them, & overcrowded due to only 2 and sometimes 1 elevator working.
I'm telling you now, do yourself a favor and move on to the next apartment complex. You do not want to live in this building.
The only positive about this place was Diamond, she worked at the receptionist desk. She was always beyond caring and nice. Mrs. Barbara seemed pretty nice as well and didn't seem like she would put up with any foolishness. Everyone else seemed like they had no idea what the fuck they were doing. I have no idea how that place is still running. What a terrible investment property that place has become, I can’t imagine how much money they are losing every month & year.

First, let me say that the staff does a great job, they are always friendly, and they are quick to take care of any maintenance issues. Their office closes at 5 pm, I did an online maintenance request around 4:40, and to my surprise, they took care of it that day before 5 pm. Now for the negative, In my 44 years, I have never once been late on making a rent payment. And with covid going around, our household income was reduced to 60-80% on average from where we were a year ago, due to both of our hours being cut. With that being said, we felt that it was important to us to continue to make our payments on time, without asking for any sort of assistance. And we continued to make out monthly payments, so fast forward to December 2020. We found out that we were expecting our first child after 9 years of marriage. So the stress, worry, and happiness has been on our mind constantly. Fast forward again to New Year's Day, which happened to fall on a Friday which meant that our rent was due sometime between the 1st and the 3rd. The 3rd just happened to be on a Sunday. So it completely slipped our minds until we got a notice to either pay or vacate from the leasing office. Not a problem at all, but I did notice a $94 late fee. I promptly called the office and spoke to the manager. I explained that the rent due date had fallen over a holiday weekend(most of which the office was closed), I stated that we could immediately make up the missed payment, but as long time residents, with zero histories of late or missed payments. Was there anything that they could do for us regarding the late payment? The manager flat out said no, and with that in mind, we had planned on living here until we moved into our own home. But after this exchange, my wife and I have decided to go ahead and start looking for a new place. We understand that rules are rules, but something should have been done for us in this instance.

I contacted maintenance 1. they tried to act like it was not mildew just ""dirt and water""  2. tried to make it seem like I should be okay with it because every one has the issue and some are worse. That did not make me feel better. So I contacted the manager, she reassured me I would receive a humidifier to help remove moisture from air. I agreed to that because it was at least a solution and not an excuse. That has also been a small run around. She was not communicating with me like I would have liked. I had to keep reaching out. She then said employees are out for holidays so it will not be until ""monday"" I said okay even though I was annoyed because Im still wiping windows mind you my sister has asthma and bad allergies and this is not helping with mildew growing. Monday comes and did not hear anything back. Left a voicemail and it is noW tuesday still nothing. Im not sure if the issue needs to be escalated but I am not happy with this. I have never experience this type of issue and I do not think it is acceptable . I almost believe it is a health hazard.

1/5/2021,JTA006273,1879547,Stassney Woods,yelp,MAA,"Full disclosure, I have never lived here, but my experience when shopping the place was so abysmal I felt it necessary to share.  It started with me walking into the office to hear the head manager (as I was later to find out) yelling at what appeared to be a maintenance worker.  He left and wished me a good day out the door.  She stays in her office for a bit talking to a coworker in Spanish.  I grew up down south and know enough to understand that she was cussing out the ""gringo"" maintenance worker.  Incredibly uncomfortable.

She came out to offer me a tour, and I'd already driven down, so I begrudgingly accepted. The tour itself was pretty basic,  Fake smiles and generic descriptions about floorplans.  Not the greatest location, which I knew ahead of time, but neither is my current place, and it's passable, just too far from the office.

However, I always make a point to check out a property at night.  When I arrived, there were cops on the scene.  The same maintenance man from the office was on-site assisting as there had been a break-in.  Apparently this is fairly commonplace as they knew each other by name.  All of this was contradictory to what the office lady had told me during the tour.  

That combined with her completely unprofessional and inappropriate treatment of her coworkers was enough to steer me away.  Looking at these other reviews, I'm glad I followed my gut.  The management here should take a serious look at the culture they're perpetuating and the slum that they're running.  Maybe there's more of a problem than just the location.",Kaitlyn C.,1

When I first moved in the neighborhood was clean, the neighbors were nice and respected the community, the people in the leasing office were a bit nicer. There's trash everywhere and I feel so bad for our groundskeepers and cleaners because our neighbors do NOT respect the community. I still despise all the changes that were made to the parking. It's DUMB. There's not enough visitors parking. The gate is always broken and takes the same amount of time to get fixed as before we had to pay monthly for parking. It's not even like our new parking fees are going to the upkeep of the garage. They only had part of the first floor painted and that was months ago. Also I have a HUGE problem with MAA as a company changing their policy to force new residents to pay rent on the first with no grace period. IN THE PANDEMIC and DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. The policy doesn't effect me but how heartless. Not all the apartments are equally renovated so make sure they show you your apartment before you move in not just the model. The construction is absolutely horrible. When I first moved in I wasn't informed that they were building the storage unit AFTER I signed my first lease. They didn't even inform anyone about the senior home being built. One day people complained about the noise and the fact that the construction randomly blocks off the road to get in and out of the neighborhood and they gave everyone a chick fil a. That was it. I ended up switching apartments. The actual apartment is nice though. Evie and Stephen are great! Love them. Stephen used to put on really good community events pre COVID. When I first moved in we had Super Bowl parties and Halloween parties all that. But when Natalie our old property manager left that's when everything went down hill. I'm not sure why they keep bringing in other PMs instead of just promoting Stephen. Every time I've ever had an issue ultimately he was the one that fixed it.

Sad that some tenants have no sense of pride in community with ignoring valet service times or picking up dog droppings or letting in non-residents thus jeopardizing safety and possessions for all. Who wants family or friends to visit when halls are jammed with garbage bags on fridays and saturdays or during christmas or new year's weekend or during thanksgiving. No one seems to get fined to curtail poor behaviour. Dogs are great but no size restriction or breed restriction. They seem to want new tenants over established ones (59 months and not one payment late) who are top shelf for caring about their communities and not wanting to live near a dump ( I did that as a kid so I know what one looks like). Rent increases during all this too? Come on...Please. Some tenants use their patio as storage. It isn't ""luxury"" any longer. Sorry. They're probably touring folks around apartments v. on pathways that don't look like we're living in a trailer park. Thus avoiding the ground floor apts with the goods or dog feces on their patio.

Been here a year. Almost killed my dog when the AC went out, car has been robbed, and entire...literally the entire complex smells like dog pee. THERE ARE NO POSITIVE QUALITIES OF THIS COMPLEX.

Event #1. AC went out.

My AC went out while I was at work with my Dog home alone for the 3rd time since moving in to this apartment last July. When I explained my concerns about my dog being left alone all day (thermostat read 91) managements response was...and I quote. ""It is Arizona"".

Really?

Event #2. Car was robbed. They don't lock any of the doors to get in to the lot, or they are propped open. The admitted to me they knew there was an issue with the locks but ""assumed"" they had been fixed.

Property features: Entire property smells like urine. Like the whole place. The dog park doesn't have pet safe turf. Pool is constantly cloudy and you can smell the dog pee from the pool.

The rent concession offers (500 off first month rent etc) are tempting. Don't be fooled.

One silver lining- maintenance man is very nice and said he would come and check on my apartment for the next few days to make sure the AC is on while I am at work since the dog is in the apartment. That was much better than Patrick's response ""umm, we don't do.

For the money you could live literally anywhere else in old town. The rent is way to high for what you get. The staff is pretty rude and condescending.

At the end of the day don't make the mistake I made. You work hard for you money and deserve to live in a safe, friendly, free of urine smell environment. I pay $1300 for a studio. If you take a tour, don't let them side step you through the courtyards. That's where the pee really hits you in the face.

We lived in 1101 so we were not in the tower but on the first floor facing the pool. We weren't able to tour because it was when everything was on lockdown so we took a virtual tour and liked everything we saw. We moved in and it was sadly downhill from there. They started renovating the pool bathrooms right next to our walls and constantly drilling and jackhammering all day for months and they never told us that this was going to happen when we were initially touring. My bf and I are used to downtown noise, we lived at 55W where the sun rail came every hour and i4 construction noise was always going and it was no where comparable to what we experienced here. I ended up complaining so much to the staff (who sympathized with me) and corporate that I was able to break my lease without penalty and my bf and I left in December. It's sad because we didn't want to move 6 months after our initial move in date but I work from home and couldn't keep dealing with the noise from the construction. I really hope they tell potential residents about future construction projects in the future to avoid situations like this",Iyana M.,3

Although I had issues with two dryers, on back to back weekends nonetheless, the crew here at Colonial Grand was expedious in replacing the faulty units first thing the following Monday.

Moving from a 3 bedroom house to a 2 bedroom apartment isn't without it's pains. But the master bedroom is larger than my old living room!  Plenty of closet space. Spacy master bath. And those 9 for ceilings with crown moulding add a terrific touch.

I wasn't sure how I would adapt to the all electric kitchen after using a gas range and stove for the last decade, however, the kitchen is absolutely beautiful. All black appliances with black granite countertops. Under cabinet mounted microwave. Track lighting  Breakfast bar with matching countertops and hanging light fixtures. Miles of cabinet space.Other than the drawers being a little narrow for my liking, this kitchen is a joyous spot to whip up a tasty meal.

Laminated wood flooring throughout the living, dining, and hallway areas is a breeze to clean.

The main bathroom is spacious and well designed.

Then there is the general appearance and location of the property itself. Beautiful, well kept landscaping with the pool currently acting as a fountain. Fairview town center is literally a stones throw away with a nice little movie theater adjacent to the property. Anything and everything you need is just a short walk away.

I would recommend this community to anyone looking for a quiet, affordable place to call home.",Ray Osborn,5

Couldn't get the dryer to start after the first load. They replaced the dryer and sure enough the start knob wasn't correct for the dryer it was on and snapped off when trying to start it. I would say NEVER start a load of clothes in the dryer at night and expect them to be dry in the morning. No issues so far with the second replacement dryer. But I'm waiting. Secondly, there is ONE trash compactor on site. Sunday afternoon is usually overflowing and has bags and boxes piled next to it. It's quite fragrant in warm days. Keys: 2 or 3 trips to the office for keys isn't uncommon. They cut then on site. Maybe they work. Maybe they won't. Another thing that I found odd was the fact I had 3 track lights in my kitchen. One of them had a broken base. Instead of fixing it they took it off. Had to put in ANOTHER maintenance request to have a replacement installed. Lastly, I don't like the fact that you have to use AT&T for internet AND cable. The internet speed you get is 12megaBITS (not bytes) per second. Sorry my friend. That is slower than dial up. I don't want cable TV. I want HULU+. A few good things are the apartments themselves are quite roomy. There is a vacuum station where you can clean your car.

Our first issue was a weed smell seeping through our vents. After days of ""trying to figure out"" where the smell was, management finally came to a conclusion and decided to give the neighbor a warning and promised us this would not happen again. Months later I am approached by the Hendersonville Police Department. A search warrant was placed on a different neighbor across the hall. Questioning my safety I complained to management. Management promised that the neighbor would be moving out in a weeks notice. 5 weeks later the neighbor was still living there. 7 Months after the first incident with the weed smell seeping through our vents, we experience the same situation. Like before we did all the things we were supposed to do and at the end of the day Managements response was....""we can't just kick them out"". The reason I gave Monthaven 2 stars is because management did finally allow us to move and break our lease at no charge.

While living here there were countless times the police were called due to safety concerns, including one time where the entire apartment was shut down because there was a manhunt conducted by the Hendersonville Police. Not once did Monthaven ever notify us.",Kayla Little,2

My apartment rained (in multiple rooms, including kitchen, bedroom, and living room) one day when there was a pipe leakage in the apartment above mine. To change  the wet portion of the carpets, dry everything, and repaint, the leasing office took 2 months! That too after repeated calls and maintenance requests. I had to live for two months with a half open carpet without carpet pad underneath, having lizards, and  a variety of insects coming out of it. The manager Deborah is of no help at all. She doesn't respond to anything at a reasonable time, despite emergencies and multiple calls.  Everything needs to be asked 10 times at least, since it's a different person from the leasing office answering the phone every time and you have to explain the whole story all over again to them. Still, there will be no use. I am yet to be reimbursed for the electricity bill of over 100$ for the month when they dried the carpets using several fans and dehumidifiers (that too after asking multiple times) when the water leaked.

Bought it and took all the hard workers and nice staff away.  I can't stand this place any longer.  All
They care about is their shining star- the new complex that just went up.
   They are So hard up for money - I recently bought a new car.  I had to go to ""the other office"" since there are no longer people working in my complex to receive a ""paper stating my name address"" in order to park in my parking garage.  The one I have parked in for 3 years.  I went in a short vacation for a few days- since Covid the DMV was behind on being able to supply my new plates- and they towed my car off premises.
My paper STATED MY NAME AND ADDRESS IN MY WINDOW of my front windshield.  I have lived here for 3 years- But yet people that don't live here follow
Drivers through the gate.  That was $375 dollars plus a missed day if work because the manager was the one who told the tow truck company to go look- These new people are not kind and act entitled.

I lived in a studio in the tower and it was the most beautiful, fairy tale view I've ever had, especially at Christmas with the lights twinkling across downtown and Thornton Park, and on the Fourth of July with fireworks. It's true there are no laundry hook-ups in the tower but that that's easily solved with an inexpensive little portable washing machine on Amazon that hooks up to the bathroom faucet and drains into the tub. Then roll it back into the closet to store away. The building was impeccably clean and well maintained during my time there. The front office team was wonderful -- whatever you needed, they took care of it asap. Solid poured concrete walls meant it was very quiet and private even with neighbors close by. This is a great building to live in if you are single. You'll be right in the middle of everything, it's a very social and friendly group of neighbors and there's always something fun going on nearby. And -- for what it's worth -- during my nearly four years there, the building was lucky for love. I was in my late 40s, had seriously given up on dating, and met my wonderful future husband about a year after moving in. Several other 20- and 30-something women also met their future husbands.

Please do yourself a favor and run for the hills if you are even thinking about leasing any of these apartments. Let's start with the property concerns.. 1. There are constantly overflowing trash compactors that smell like death in the hot Florida sun. 2. inconsistent water temperatures that depends on how many of your neighbors have showered within the last hour of you. 3. You will hear every step your above neighbor makes as well as every conversation (or tuba playing lesson in my case) your neighbors have. 4. If you live near the pool, you can hear other residents partying all night and on week nights. Pool hours are not enforced and people will be out there for hours after dark (which is the supposed closing time). Now for the really concerning part (if you thought none of that was of concern).. I am surprised you have made it this far! 5. Within a month of moving in our alarm was broken. When it broke, it had a high pitched ringing that could not be turned off. I called the after-hours maintenance line as it was a weekend and no one showed for two days. Myself and my partner had to leave the apartment all weekend until maintenance came out that Monday to turn it off. After the property company was aware, they told us the battery was done and that they could not get a replacement because the batteries are no longer made. They told us that if we wanted it fixed, we needed to pay an alarm company to come out and install an alarm for us that we will also be paying for out of pocket and not reimbursed. 5. Pest control will walk into your apartment and spray without your acknowledgement. When you complain to the office that some random guy walked into your apartment, they will tell you rescheduling is not an option and you got one email about it a week ago and that is supposed to be adequate notice. THEY WILL BREAK THE CONTRACT! In the contract it states anyone entering the apartment must be accompanied by a leasing agent to oversee which was not the case. They give random people keys to access your apartment by themselves!! Orlando is the 3rd leading sex trafficking city in the nation and this is how they conduct business. The only reason I knew about it was because of my personally installed cameras. 6. Maintenance will never fix anything. After 7 months of living with damage that they knew about upon move in, it still is not fixed. If you ""schedule"" a maintenance request, they come out whenever they want. If you put on the form that they are not allowed to enter unless you are there, they will cancel the request and make you resubmit as many times as it takes for you to be home when they wander by to fix your things. If you complain to management about maintenance, they make excuses but never fix anything. 7. Maintenance ruined our property and a package at the door by pressure washing it. 8. Lastly, they will make you pay to terminate your contract after all of this negligence and act surprised you want to move out. We broke a 13mo contract short to 6 mo We were told by the NEW OFFICE MANAGER that ""if we just let people out of contracts, we wouldn't make any money"".

You have to get the Internet and cable here and covered parking is a must because all the free spaces are full by 7pm. By the end of it you'll be paying about $180 of water and fees on top of your rent, so take that into consideration when budgeting.

I was in a situation where I had to move ASAP and they made the whole process very quick and smooth and we're up front with all the move in fees, deposits, etc. As far as the apt itself, no issues so far. It's a little small but they have bigger floor plans available. Price is very decent and affordable. The only cons I can speak on is the parking is not that great, and the complex itself is a little crammed as far as the way it was built. Not much space between units and drive ways. But somehow it still has a peaceful atmosphere about it. There's only one dumpster for the whole complex and would be so much nicer if there was at least a 2nd.

There were multiple after hours reports filed, and they could care less.

12/23/2020,JTA033709,1862724,Copper Ridge,google,MAA,"Management doesn’t care. I have been suffering from a downstairs neighbor who loves to blast music that shakes my floor and pound on the ceiling for any movement we make, which is considered harassment. I’ve called and emailed management multiple times and only told to contact a courtesy officer in the after hours. This does nothing to resolve my issue but there isn’t anything I can do except wait until my lease is over. This is an issue that’s been ongoing for months.

It’s very unfortunate as well that I’ve been told to keep the noise down because I’m bothering my neighbor during normal daytime hours from my kids playing and that a courtesy officer was supposedly at my door. So I’m warned for things I can’t help but the person below me can keep blasting her music all hours of the day on and off. Stressful, awful experience.",Megan Rodriguez,1
12/23/2020,JTA065916,1862732,MAA Midtown,google,MAA,Thanksgiving weekend we met with Rachael Wallace for a tour.  She was professional & thorough. She was aware of our desires before we arrived and was well prepared with several units to show us.  Since we are relocating to Atlanta in January she has shown great patience as I have had a tough time making a decision moving from a house to an apartment.  My endless emails & texts have been met with quick responses and always a kind word.  She is well informed and answered every concern with great satisfaction.  I gave 4 stars because we haven't moved in yet so will wait and update this review once we get there.  I highly recommend meeting with Rachael when looking to tour MAA.  We look forward to living at MAA.,Mary Knost,4

Other than that, the staff is great, they met every maintenance request in a timely manner and were always professional.
